# Python useful projects :snake:

This repository provides a collection of concise and practical Python scripts and tools. Some projects are designed for my personal use, while others are inspired by projects found in collaborative repositories like [Python-World/python-mini-projects](https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects/), making them more general-purpose. Hope you enjoy it :blue_heart:
