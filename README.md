# Python useful projects :snake:

This repository provides a collection of concise and practical Python scripts and tools. Some projects are designed for my personal use (e.g., web scrapers), while others are inspired by projects found in collaborative repositories like [Python-World/python-mini-projects](https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects/), making them more general-purpose.

This repository is named 'useful projects' because I want to rescue those 'mini' projects (typically created for practice and to progressively improve programming and language understanding) that provide real-world utility for daily applications or targeted problem-solving, such as a file encryptor, a text-to-speech converter, a Discord bot, and so on.

Hope you enjoy it :blue_heart:
